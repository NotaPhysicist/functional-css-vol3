                     One of my favorite quotes is by Frank Herbert from his sci-fi novel - Dune: "Muad'Dib learned rapidly because his first training was in how to learn. And the first lesson of all was the basic trust that he could learn." Earning a Ph.D. was principal in learning to adapt cognitively. There were no multiple choice true/false exams. No PowerPoint slides to memorize. During the coursework years my peers and I spent 40 hours a week reading. It was a world in which one learned to define problems and to think about them conceptually. The five years that I spent at the university of Arkansas were the renaissance and the major highlight of my life.

                     Studying for a Master of Science went hand in hand went hand in hand with developing one of the largest systems that I have ever delivered: Copier Billings Management System (CBMS&trade;). This enterprise-wide application bought together various departments and handled inventory management, financial accounting, fraud detection, and detailed reporting. The first version of the system went live in April of 2003 and was used by the University of Memphis for over 10 years.

                     Earning my degree coincided with strong practical experience that ranged from building servers, configuring and networking servers, designing applications, and then implementing these applications using such platforms as HTML/CSS, PHP, MySQL, and Apache. The latter I mastered on my own as universities were slow to introduce curriculum that taught application development using LAMP. On the side, I also wrote web applications using C language. With experimentation I learning a lot about web applications and programming in general, and even had to extend one of the CGI libraries by writing a HTTP parser.

                  The bulk of my experience centers on building web-based systems for universities and some companies. The main theme that unites my software is optimization of internal resources. Many of the programs were built because I saw an oppurtunity to create a better work structure and the took the initiative and responsibility that comes with it.

                  Studying psychology and user-interface interaction, coupled with in-depth knowledge of HTML and CSS, allowed me to venture into the territory of GUI design and build elements that allow for intuitive and laborless user experiences.

                  Every single application that I have developed requires some form of data storage. Most of the solutions utilized relational databases that had anywhere from 2 to 99 tables. Some programs functioned optimally with flat file storage or a combination of both.
