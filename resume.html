                     One of my favorite quotes is by Frank Herbert from his
                     sci-fi novel - Dune: "Muad'Dib learned
                     rapidly because his first training was in how to learn. And
                     the first lesson of all was the basic
                     trust that he could learn." Earning a Ph.D. was principal
                     in learning to adapt cognitively. There
                     were no multiple choice true/false exams. No PowerPoint
                     slides to memorize. During the coursework
                     years my peers and I spent 40 hours a week reading. It was
                     a world in which one learned to define
                     problems and to think about them conceptually. The five
                     years that I spent at the university of
                     Arkansas were the renaissance and the major highlight of my
                     life.

                     Studying for a Master of Science went hand in hand went
                     hand in hand with developing one of the
                     largest systems that I have ever delivered: Copier Billings
                     Management System (CBMS&trade;). This
                     enterprise-wide application bought together various
                     departments and handled inventory management,
                     financial accounting, fraud detection, and detailed
                     reporting. The first version of the system went
                     live in April of 2003 and was used by the University of
                     Memphis for over 10 years.

                     Earning my degree coincided with strong practical
                     experience that ranged from building servers,
                     configuring and networking servers, designing applications,
                     and then implementing these
                     applications using such platforms as HTML/CSS, PHP, MySQL,
                     and Apache. The latter I mastered on my
                     own as universities were slow to introduce curriculum that
                     taught application development using
                     LAMP. On the side, I also wrote web applications using C
                     language. With experimentation I learning
                     a lot about web applications and programming in general,
                     and even had to extend one of the CGI
                     libraries by writing a HTTP parser.

                  systems for universities and some companies.
                  The main theme that unites my software is optimization of

                  were built because I saw an oppurtunity to create a better
                  work structure and the took the initiative
                  and responsibility that comes with it.

                  2 to 99 tables. Some programs
                  functioned optimally with flat file storage or a combination

                  Writing is akin to teaching, only harder. This especially
                  applies to technical and instructional
                  writing. Encapsulating a dynamic process of programming using
                  a very a very static media forces one to
                  present cases as simply, yet as fully, as possible. I have
                  learned that a really good way to master a
                  technology is to create a practical guide for it.

               <p>
                  Social desirability bias occurs when survey participants
                  answer questions in a
                  socially acceptable way rather than sharing their true
                  perceptions. The software
                  was constructed to examine how social desirability, under
                  diverse conditions,
                  affected various statistics (Built with JavaScript and

                  The goals driving the system's implementation were three-fold:
                  1) centralize
                  information pertaining to RFID testing via database
                  implementation, 2) stabilize
                  the testing process by embedding it into the software, and 3)
                  create functionality
                  to mine the data stored in the database. RFID Project
                  Management System stands at
                  75,000 lines of code and was implemented on top of a database
                  that has 99 tables.

               <p>
                  Non-sampling errors are the most pervasive and deleterious biases that affect empirical results. It is very difficult to study these phenomena directly, because
                  the necessary data is next to impossible to obtain. Instead, a
                  simulation software
                  was written that faithfully mimicked non-sampling biases,
                  allowing in-depth
                  understanding of the errors' operation and enabling the
                  derivation of methods to
                  prevent the biases altogether. (Built with Java).
